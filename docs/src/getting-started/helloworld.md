# Hello World

We created a sample hello world app on [Hello Murder](https://github.com/isadorasophia/hellomurder). We should cover more on that soon. 

You can take a peek at [IMurderGame](../Murder/IMurderGame.html) on tweaking basic functionality into your game, but a lot of things should be ready to go from the editor project.
